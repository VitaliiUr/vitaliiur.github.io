title = {Near-field coded-mask technique and its potential for proton therapy monitoring},
journal = {Physics in Medicine {\&} Biology},
abstract = {Objective. Prompt-gamma imaging encompasses several approaches to the online monitoring of the beam range or deposited dose distribution in proton therapy. We test one of the imaging techniques - a coded mask approach - both experimentally and via simulations. Approach. Two imaging setups have been investigated experimentally. Each of them comprised a structured tungsten collimator in the form of a modified uniformly redundant array mask and a LYSO:Ce scintillation detector of fine granularity. The setups differed in detector dimensions and operation mode (1D or 2D imaging). A series of measurements with radioactive sources have been conducted, testing the performance of the setups for near-field gamma imaging. Additionally, Monte Carlo simulations of a larger setup of the same type were conducted, investigating its performance with a realistic gamma source distribution occurring during proton therapy. Main results. The images of point-like sources reconstructed from two small-scale prototypes’ data using the maximum-likelihood expectation maximisation algorithm constitute the experimental proof of principle for the near-field coded-mask imaging modality, both in the 1D and the 2D mode. Their precision allowed us to calibrate out certain systematic offsets appearing due to the limited alignment accuracy of setup elements. The simulation of the full-scale setup yielded a mean distal falloff retrieval precision of 0.72 mm in the studies for beam energy range 89.5–107.9 MeV and with 1 × 108 protons (a typical number for distal spots). The implemented algorithm of image reconstruction is relatively fast—a typical procedure needs several seconds. Significance. Coded-mask imaging appears a valid option for proton therapy monitoring. The results of simulations let us conclude that the proposed full-scale setup is competitive with the knife-edge-shaped and the multi-parallel slit cameras investigated by other groups.}

title = {Comparison of readout systems for high-rate silicon photomultiplier applications},
journal = {Journal of Instrumentation},
abstract = {Recent years have shown an increased use of silicon photomultipliers (SiPM) in experiments as they are of reasonable cost, have relatively low power consumption and are easily available in a variety of form factors allowing for a large number of readout channels. At the same time, experiments are generating data at increasingly high rates requiring the use of more efficient readout systems. In this work, the dead time, efficiency, dynamic range, coincidence time resolution and energy resolution of five different readout systems at various stages of maturity are evaluated to determine the best system for acquiring data from a detector in a high rate experiment. Additional functionalities of the systems are also discussed.}
