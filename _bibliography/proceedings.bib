  abstract  = {A recent paper by P. Reinert et al. [Eur. Phys. J. A54, 86 (2018)] showed a possibility of improving chiral nucleon-nucleon potential models by employing a semi-local regularization in momentum space. The authors derived nucleon-nucleon potentials with this kind of regularization completely up to the fifth order of the chiral expansion and considered additionally some contact interactions which appear at the sixth order. Such a chiral interaction has never been applied to study electromagnetic processes in two- or three-nucleon systems. Here we continue our research of photodisintegration processes, now using the improved chiral force. In particular, we discuss our predictions for the deuteron photodisintegration reaction in the photon energy range up to 100 MeV. The results of our calculations reveal that the new potential yields predictions characterized by a weaker dependence on the regularization parameter and faster convergence with respect to the chiral expansion order compared to the older chiral potentials.}
